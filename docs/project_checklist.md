# AquaFlow - A1 Grade Checklist
> Derived directly from the professor's marking criteria lecture.
> Each item maps to a specific graded criterion. **All boxes must be checked for A1.**

---

## 1. Code Structure - SOLID Principles

> Professor: *"A is really that you have thought through this, understood the right choices, and applied these professionally."*
> Global variables, no SOLID evidence → D/E. No evidence at all → F.

### S - Single Responsibility Principle
- [x] **Every class has exactly ONE clearly-defined responsibility.** No "god classes" doing multiple jobs (e.g., a class that both reads the sensor AND controls the pump AND logs simultaneously).
- [x] **Confirm current classes are properly separated:** `GestureSensor`, `PumpController`, `FlowMeter`, `LcdDisplay`, `FillingController`, `Monitor`, `Timer`, `Logger` - each should own one concern only.
- [x] **Document in README/docs** which responsibility each class owns (justifies SRP compliance to the marker).
  - *Note: `PumpController`: logging via `Logger`; responsibility = pump GPIO control.*

### O - Open/Closed Principle
- [x] **Base classes exist that can be extended without modification.** e.g., `IHardwareDevice` as the base - new sensors should be addable by inheritance, not by editing existing classes.
- [x] **Check `IHardwareDevice.h`** - does it provide a solid enough base that `FlowMeter`, `PumpController` etc. inherit from it without modifying the base?
- [x] **Use inheritance + virtual functions** to add functionality (e.g., a future `4-channel ADC` class extends a base `ADC` class).
- [x] **Document your inheritance hierarchy** - show it in a UML diagram.
  - *Status note (2026-04-14): `IHardwareDevice` is used by `PumpController`, `FlowMeter`, `GestureSensor`, and `LcdDisplay`; behavioral interfaces (`IProximitySensor`, `IPump`, `IFlowMeter`) are now consumed by `FillingController`; UML diagram added in `docs/architecture.md`.*

### L - Liskov Substitution Principle
- [x] **Base class interfaces are future-proof.** If you swap a derived class for the base class, nothing breaks.
- [x] **Specifically: callbacks/interfaces in base classes must be flexible enough** to accommodate future derived classes (e.g., use `std::vector<float>` instead of a single `float` in callbacks so multi-channel readings don't break the interface).
- [x] **Check `IHardwareDevice.h`** - if it declares a `getData()` callback with a fixed return type, verify the derived classes don't break substitutability.
- [x] **Document in code comments/docs** your reasoning on Liskov compliance or why you consciously relaxed it.
  - *Status note (2026-04-15): `IHardwareDevice` is lifecycle-only by design (no fixed `getData()`), `GestureEvent` carries both scalar and vector payloads for backward compatibility + multi-channel extension, and `lsp_stress_test` (`tests/LiskovSubstitutionStressTest.cpp`) validates substitution across lifecycle, callbacks, and `FillingController` orchestration.*
### I - Interface Segregation Principle
- [x] **No bloated interfaces.** Each class/callback interface exposes ONLY what the consumer needs - not a massive omnibus interface.
- [x] **Sensor-specific callbacks are separate** - e.g., a flow reading callback is distinct from a gesture event callback; they're not crammed into one generic handler.
- [x] **Verify** that no single class is being used as a catch-all for unrelated data.

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle
- [x] **Decision documented:** Professor explicitly said DIP is hard in C++ and is optional - but your **choice must be documented** (in README/docs) explaining why you did or didn't apply it.
- [x] **(Optional, high marks):** If attempting DIP, use C++ templates to decouple high-level logic from low-level hardware drivers so either can be swapped independently. *(Note: Achieved via runtime interfaces instead of templates, documented ADR).*
- [x] **At minimum:** ensure high-level modules (`FillingController`) depend on **abstractions** (`IHardwareDevice` / `IPump`), not concrete classes directly.

---

## 2. Encapsulation

> Professor: *"A = clearly defined public interface, all variables in private, access only via getters/setters/callbacks, efficient internal data structures."*
> Global variables → D/E instantly. Everything dumped in `main` → F.

- [x] **Zero global variables.** Do a full search across all `.cpp` and `.h` files. Any global mutable state is an immediate D/E.
  - *Status note (2026-04-15): Full `.cpp`/`.h` audit completed. Removed mutable namespace-scope state (`Logger::mutex_` static storage and `keepRunning` globals in integration tests). Remaining `static` uses are immutable constants (`constexpr`/`const`) or static methods only.*
- [x] **All member variables are `private`** (or `protected` where justified). No `public` data members.
  - *Status note (2026-04-15): Evaluated codebase: refactored GestureEvent and CallbackStats structures to explicitly make fields private and exposed matching getter/setter interfaces. 100% of authored classes/structs are fully encapsulated.*
- [x] **All data access is through getters, setters, or callbacks only.** No direct member access from outside the class.
  - *Status note (2026-04-15): Audit complete. All custom C++ classes use strict getter/setter/callback encapsulation. The only direct field access is on standard POSIX C structs (itimerspec, timespec) required for kernel system calls, which are exempt from OOP rules.*
- [x] **Internal data structures are efficient** - e.g., consider using `std::atomic` for shared sensor readings, ring buffers or double-buffering for high-frequency data.
  - *Status note (2026-04-15): Audit complete. Replaced `std::vector` inside `GestureEvent` with a stack-allocated bounded container (`InlineChannels`) to eliminate per-event heap allocations in user-space payload handling during sensor ticks. Atomics and bounded buffers are used across threaded components.*
- [x] **`main.cpp` contains only initialisation code** - no real-time logic, no loops, no processing. After init, it simply blocks on `sigwait()`.
  - *Status note (2026-04-15): Extracted all timer wiring, display rendering, and shutdown orchestration into a dedicated `AquaFlowApp` class. `main.cpp` now strictly executes dependency injection and blocks passively.*
- [x] **All callbacks are transmitted through `std::function` or abstract interface** - not via raw global function pointers.
  - *Status note (2026-04-15): Audit complete. EventCallback, TimerCallback, and MonitorCallback implementations strictly utilise std::function for observer transmission.*
- [x] **Safe data receiving and releasing** - verify fault-checking mechanisms are in place when sensors disconnect or provide erroneous data.
  - *Status note (2026-04-15): Guarded all detached hardware threads and public APIs against transport layer exceptions. Handled initialisation race conditions and prevented application crashes on bus detachments.*

---

## 3. Memory Management

> Professor: *"Use STL. Use smart pointers. Never void pointers. Never malloc. Prefer copy constructors."*
> `void*` or `malloc` = "deal-breaker" for this criterion.

- [x] **No raw `new`/`delete` unless absolutely required** (e.g., Qt forces it). Use RAII.
  - *Status note (2026-04-15): Codebase audit confirms complete absence of raw allocation mechanisms. All memory lifecycle boundaries rely implicitly on scope deterministic destruction and robust smart pointer architectures.*
- [x] **No `malloc`/`free` anywhere in the codebase.** Run a search.
  - *Status note (2026-04-15): Source file search confirms absolute absence of manual memory operations. Discovered nomenclature exclusively inhabits non executable documentation boundaries.*
- [x] **No `void*` pointers anywhere.** Run a search.
  - *Status note (2026-04-15): Type erasure audit confirms complete absence of void pointers across all source logic. Type safety is strictly guaranteed through explicit object typings and abstractions.*
- [ ] **Use `std::shared_ptr` / `std::unique_ptr`** for any dynamically allocated objects.
- [ ] **Prefer copy constructors / value semantics** - assign objects directly (e.g., `std::thread thr = std::thread(...)`) instead of heap allocation.
- [ ] **Use STL containers** (`std::vector`, `std::queue`, `std::deque`) instead of C-style arrays where possible.
- [ ] **Review Rule of 3 / Rule of 5** - if any class manages a resource (thread, file handle, socket), ensure copy constructor, copy assignment, and destructor are properly defined (or explicitly deleted).
- [ ] **No memory leaks** - verify all threads are joined, all connections closed, all resources released in `shutdown()` methods.

## 4. Real-Time Coding

> Professor: *"This is the most important thing - and the easiest way to get marks."*
> Arduino-style polling loops, `sleep()`-based timing, or a frozen UI = automatic fail for this criterion.

### 4a. Timing Requirements - DOCUMENT THIS (easy marks, often missed!)
- [ ] **State your system's timing requirements explicitly in the README or docs.** e.g.:
  - *"The pump must respond to a cup-detected event within 50 ms of a proximity event."*
  - *"The flow meter samples at interrupt-driven rate; callback must complete in < 10 ms."*
  - *"The GestureSensor polls the APDS-9960 FIFO every 50 ms via timerfd."*
  - *"The state-machine tick fires every 100 ms via timerfd."*
  - Professor says ~30% of teams miss this and "earn a straight fail for it" - **do not skip**.

### 4b. Event-Driven, Non-Blocking Architecture
- [ ] **No polling loops.** No `while(true) { check_sensor(); sleep(100ms); }` patterns.
- [ ] **All I/O is event-driven:** threads block on a hardware event (GPIO interrupt, timerfd, I2C data-ready pin) and wake up only when data arrives.
- [ ] **`Timer` class uses `timerfd`** (or equivalent blocking mechanism) - not a `sleep()` loop.
  -  **Current state:** `main.cpp` uses `loopTimer.registerCallback()` - confirm `Timer` internally uses `timerfd` or `std::condition_variable`, not `sleep()`.
- [ ] **`FlowMeter` uses GPIO interrupt** on the pulse pin - not polling.
- [x] **`GestureSensor` uses `timerfd` blocking read** - replaced `sleep_for(50ms)` polling with a kernel-managed timerfd. Zero CPU between firings. ✅ Done.
- [ ] **No `sleep()` or `usleep()` used to establish timing.** These are unreliable on Linux (multitasking OS). Search the codebase.

### 4c. Fast & Deterministic Callbacks
- [ ] **Callbacks in sensor drivers are fast and deterministic.** No heavy computation, no I/O, no blocking calls inside a callback.
- [ ] **Slow/unpredictable work (e.g., any processing logic) is offloaded** to a separate `std::thread` - the callback just queues the data and returns.
- [ ] **`FillingController::tick()`** (called from timer callback) must be deterministic - no unbounded loops or I/O inside it.

### 4d. Thread Architecture
- [ ] **Each blocking I/O operation runs in its own dedicated worker thread:**
  - `Timer` worker thread (timerfd → `FillingController::tick()` callback)
  - `FlowMeter` worker thread (GPIO interrupt → pulse count, `atomic<int>`)
  - `GestureSensor` worker thread (timerfd → I2C FIFO read → proximity callback → `atomic<bool>` in `FillingController`)
- [ ] **`main()` thread only sleeps** (via `sigwait`) - it does not participate in any real-time processing.
- [ ] **Thread-safe data sharing** - use `std::atomic` or `std::mutex`+`std::lock_guard` for any data accessed from multiple threads.
- [ ] **No dead locks** - verify no two mutexes are locked in opposite orders in different threads.

---

## 5. Revision Control & Project Management

> Professor: *"Last-minute single upload = very low marks. Only one person committing = visible, penalised."*

### 5a. Git Commit & Release Quality
- [ ] **GitHub Release created by the deadline** - the professor will download and mark the latest *release*, not just the latest pushed commit. Don't forget to cut a tag/release!
- [ ] **Every commit has a descriptive message** - not "updated file", "fix", or "changes". Each message should explain WHAT was changed and WHY.
- [ ] **Commits reference issues where applicable** - e.g., "Fixed flow meter callback race condition (closes #12)".
- [ ] **Use git from the command line** (not just GUI drag-and-drop) to ensure full, detailed commit messages.
- [ ] **Commits are frequent and incremental** - showing a clear development history, not a single bulk upload at the end.

### 5b. Branching Strategy
- [ ] **Feature branches are used** - each feature/component developed on its own branch.
- [ ] **Branches are merged into `main`** via pull requests (or at least documented merges).
- [ ] **GitHub's commit graph** shows a visible branching and merging history (professor says "I look at this graph").
- [ ] **All team members have committed** - the Git log must show contributions from multiple people.

### 5c. Project Management Evidence
- [ ] **Use GitHub Issues or GitHub Projects** to track work items / tasks.
- [ ] **Issues reference commits** - ("closes #X" in commit messages links the commit to the issue).
- [ ] **Sprint-based or milestone-based planning visible** - show at least weekly progress updates or milestones.
- [ ] **All team members are visible as contributors** in the project management tool.
- [ ] **Clear division of labor marked** - each group member's specific area of responsibility must be clearly documented in the README or final report.

---

## 6. Documentation, Testing & PR

### 6a. Unit Tests (CMake `make test`)
- [ ] **Unit tests exist for each major class** (not just integration tests).
- [ ] **`CMakeLists.txt` has `enable_testing()` and `add_subdirectory(tests)`.**
- [ ] **Running `make test` from the build directory executes all tests automatically.**
- [ ] **Tests are meaningful** - they send known inputs and verify expected outputs (e.g., send fake pulse counts to `FlowMeter`, verify `getVolumeML()` returns the correct value).
- [ ] **(Optional, high marks):** Use **Google Test (`gtest`)** framework for structured, industry-standard unit tests.
- [ ] **Test coverage includes:** `FlowMeter`, `PumpController`, `FillingController` state machine transitions, `Timer` callback firing.

### 6b. README / Installation Documentation
- [ ] **Prerequisites listed** - exact `apt-get install` commands needed (e.g., `libgpiodcxx`, `cmake`).
- [ ] **Build instructions** - exact `cmake .. && make` commands.
- [ ] **`make test` instructions** - how to run unit tests.
- [ ] **Bill of Materials (BoM) under £75** - list every hardware component with cost and explicitly verify the total is under the £75 budget limit.
- [ ] **Hardware wiring diagram** - circuit diagram or clear wiring table ( partial - README has wiring tables, add a proper circuit diagram image).
- [ ] **Installation on fresh Raspberry Pi** - step-by-step from a blank Pi to running system.
- [ ] **Timing requirements documented** (see 4a - this overlaps with real-time criterion).

### 6c. Code-Level Documentation
- [ ] **All public class members documented** - every public method, callback, and data member has a comment explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.
- [ ] **(Recommended):** Use **Doxygen-compatible comment syntax** (`/** @brief ... @param ... @return ... */`) so documentation can be auto-generated.
- [ ] **Callback signatures documented** - explain exactly what each callback delivers and when it fires.
- [ ] **Design decisions documented** - the `docs/decisions.md` (already exists ) should explain SOLID choices, thread design decisions, and any trade-offs.

### 6d. UML / Architecture Diagrams
- [ ] **UML class diagram** showing all classes and their relationships (inheritance, composition, dependencies).
- [ ] **Timing/sequence diagram** showing the temporal flow of events (e.g., cup detected → gesture event → state machine → pump on → flow meter pulses → pump off).
- [ ] **System architecture diagram** showing how hardware components connect to software classes.
- [ ] Include these diagrams in the README or a dedicated `docs/architecture.md`.

### 6e. PR / Social Media & Open Source
- [ ] **Demo video** - a short YouTube/video clip showing the system working end-to-end.
- [ ] **Project logo/branding** (professor highlighted the Brew Genie team for this).
- [ ] **(Stretch):** Technical blog post or write-up (professor mentioned RS Design Spark article).
- [ ] Link any social/PR content from the README.
- [ ] **Project Licensing** - ensure your repository has an open-source license file (e.g., MIT, GPL), as it's evaluated under the Promotion criteria.

## Deal-Breakers (Automatic Fail / Zero for That Criterion)

> These will kill your grade. Verify **none** of these apply.

- [ ]  **Not using C++** - the project MUST be C++.  (already C++)
- [ ]  **Program becomes unresponsive** under normal operation - e.g., UI freezes during processing.
- [ ]  **`sleep()`/`wait()` used for timing** instead of event-driven architecture.
- [ ]  **Single massive polling loop** (Arduino `loop()` style).
- [ ]  **Global variables** used anywhere.
- [ ]  **`void*` pointers or `malloc()`** anywhere in the code.
- [ ]  **No revision control history** - only one commit at the very end.
- [ ]  **Only one team member committing** - all members must have visible contributions.
- [ ]  **Trivial project scope** - minimal code, mostly PR fluff (not a concern for AquaFlow, but worth confirming sufficient code depth).
- [ ]  **Not plotting values on screen** - technical requirements explicitly state the system must measure values AND *plot them*.
- [ ]  **No mouse interaction** - technical requirements explicitly state the UI must allow *mouse interaction* to change parameters.
- [ ]  **Not running as a standalone embedded app** - the system MUST boot up automatically as a standalone application on the Raspberry Pi without manual terminal interference.

## Quick-Wins (Highest ROI, Easiest to Miss)

These are the things the professor explicitly says teams consistently skip and "earn a straight fail" for:

1. ** Write the timing requirements down** - literally one paragraph in the README stating response times.
2. ** Improve commit messages** - run through your Git log and ensure no "updated file" messages exist.
3. ** Run `make test`** - ensure tests execute cleanly from a fresh build.
4. ** Add a UML diagram** - even a simple hand-drawn one photographed and uploaded.
5. ** Record a demo video** - even a 60-second phone recording of the dispenser working.
