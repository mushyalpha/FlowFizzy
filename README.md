## Project Overview

This project implements a small automatic bottle filling system using a Raspberry Pi 5 programmed in C++. The goal is to demonstrate how a low-cost embedded system can automate a water dispensing process similar to those used in industrial filling systems.

The system detects when a bottle is placed under the filling nozzle using an ultrasonic sensor. Once the bottle is detected and remains in place for a short confirmation period, the Raspberry Pi activates a small DC water pump.

Water flows through a flow sensor that produces electrical pulses proportional to the water volume. The Raspberry Pi counts these pulses in real time to determine how much water has been dispensed. When the target volume is reached, the pump is switched off automatically.

The complete automated cycle is:

detect → pump → measure → stop

# Problem Statement

Manually filling bottles is slow and inconsistent. Human error often causes bottles to be overfilled or underfilled. Industrial bottling plants solve this using automated filling machines, but these systems are expensive.

This project explores whether a similar concept can be implemented using a Raspberry Pi and low-cost sensors.

The main challenges are:

- Detecting when a bottle is positioned correctly
- Measuring water volume accurately
- Turning the pump on and off at the correct moment
- Coordinating sensors and actuators reliably

# System Architecture

## Physical Layout

The water path is simple. A small pump pushes water from a container through the flow sensor and out through the filling nozzle.

# System Operation

The system works through a simple automated cycle.

| Step | Action |
|----|----|
| Step 1 | System waits for bottle |
| Step 2 | Ultrasonic sensor detects bottle |
| Step 3 | Bottle position confirmed |
| Step 4 | Pump starts |
| Step 5 | Flow sensor pulses counted |
| Step 6 | Target volume reached |
| Step 7 | Pump stops and system resets |

| `UltrasonicSensor` | Measures bottle distance |
| `PumpController` | Controls pump operation |
| `FlowMeter` | Counts pulses and calculates volume |
| `FillingController` | Controls system logic |
| `Monitor` | Displays system status |

# Control Logic

The system operates using a simple **state machine**.
